# Personalized League of Legends Stats Tracker

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an ongoing development of an application that utilizes Riot API endpoints to gather and organize statistics for a single user. For this, I acquired a permanent API key to access all the information I need from Riot Games and created functions to process such information in a way that my single user desired through a continuous development and feedback loop. 

## ✨ Features

- Utilizes real-time account information from Riot API 
- Displays information in simple tables that are easily understood

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- HTML/CSS

## 📥 Installation

1. Download all files
2. Run LEAGUE API.py
3. Navigate to the Flask Localhost Address to open the Application
