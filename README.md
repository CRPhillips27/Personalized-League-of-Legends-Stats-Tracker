As per the requirements of CMSC 128 in the BS Computer Science course in University of the Philippines Tacloban College, I utilized Riot API endpoints to create this simple application to 
organize League of Legends statistics for a singular player while adhering to software development methods and principals. For this project I utilized a SCRUM SDLC framework along with 
Python, Flask, and HTML/CSS for the full-stack deveopment of this application.
